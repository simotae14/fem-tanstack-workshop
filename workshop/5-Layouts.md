# Layouts

## Objectives

- Create a layout
- Load data in it (yes you can do that)
- Revalidate our layout

## Layouts 101

- Specify via the name route.tsx
- Allows you to specify shared markup for all pages underneath
- Allows you to load data for use by all pages underneath

## Layouts are not special

```ts
// admin/route.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/app/admin")({
  component: RouteComponent,
});
```

This is a layout, but it looks just like any other, "normal" route, because it is.

It takes the same loader argument, if you want. Data fetched in a layout are merged, and available (and statically typed!) in any pages underneath the layout.

This pairs well with the invalidation we just saw. If some (shared) pieces of data can be moved to a load, the pages underneath can be invalidated without needing to reload the data loaded in the layouts.
